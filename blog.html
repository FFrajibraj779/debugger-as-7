                        sessionStorage in js ?</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-capitalize"> <span class="fw-bold fs-4">Answer: </span> localStorage and
                        sessionStorage is similar .but some difference in there. the difference is that while data in
                        localStorage doesnt expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session
                        ends.localStorage is not session based, sessionStorage is session based.maximum capacity of
                        localStorage 10mb, on the other hand sessionStorage maximum capacity 5mb. </p>

                        js ?</h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-capitalize"><span class="fw-bold fs-4">Answer: </span>
                        the variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables
                        and have global scope. global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                        that program, any fucntion or conditional state can access that variable. a block scoped
                        variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible form outside the
                        block.let, const is a block scope and var is a global scope.

                    <p class="fs-5 text-capitalize"> <span class="fw-bold fs-4">Answer: </span>
                        There aree many ways to get undefine . some of example in below:
                    <ol>
                        <li>when variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>
                        <li>property that doesnt exists on an object will give you undefined.</li>
                        <li>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.</li>
                        <li>A function returns undefined if a value was not returned</li>
                        <li> deleting an element inside an array you get undefined.</li>
                        <li>accessing array elements outside of the index range.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="fs-5 text-capitalize"> <span class="fw-bold fs-4">Answer: </span>
                        the event loop is the secret behind javaScript asynchronous programming. js executes all
                        operations on a single thead, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                        multi-threading. the call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line
                        ot be Exucuted.whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.. the event queue is
                        reposible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. it follows the queue data
                        structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.
                    </p>
